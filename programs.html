        <h2>Our Programs</h2>
        <p>At Novel Vibrations, we offer a range of programs designed to support healing, skill development, and personal growth through creative expression. Our programs are free and open to adult individuals experiencing homelessness or mental health challenges in the Atlanta area.</p>

        <h3>Art Therapy Workshops</h3>
        <p>Our core program offers regular art therapy sessions led by trained art therapists. Participants can explore various artistic mediums, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Painting (acrylic, watercolor, oil)</li>
            <li>Drawing (pencil, charcoal, pastel)</li>
            <li>Sculpture</li>
            <li>Mixed media and collage</li>
            <li>Digital art</li>
            <li>Photography</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These workshops provide a safe, non-judgmental space for self-expression, emotional processing, and skill development. No prior artistic experience is necessary.</p>

        <h3>Entrepreneurship Training</h3>
        <p>We believe in empowering our participants to turn their creativity into sustainable income. Our entrepreneurship program covers essential business skills, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pricing and marketing artwork</li>
            <li>Basic financial management</li>
            <li>Customer service and communication</li>
            <li>Online sales and social media promotion</li>
            <li>Participating in art markets and exhibitions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Art Exhibitions and Sales</h3>
        <p>We regularly organize exhibitions to showcase our participants' artwork. These events provide opportunities for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Public recognition of our artists' talents</li>
            <li>Sales of artwork, with proceeds going directly to the artists</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Peer Support Groups</h3>
        <p>We facilitate peer support groups where participants can share their experiences, challenges, and successes in a supportive environment. These groups help build community and reduce isolation.</p>

        <h3>Collaborative Art Projects</h3>
        <p>We organize group projects that allow participants to work together on larger-scale artworks. These collaborations foster teamwork, communication skills, and a sense of shared accomplishment.</p>

            <li>Awareness campaigns about mental health and homelessness</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Support Services</h3>
        <p>While our focus is on creative expression, we recognize that our participants often face multiple challenges. We provide referrals and connections to partner organizations for additional support, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Housing assistance</li>
